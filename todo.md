# IDEAS

- Remove Takeout X folder after merge
- Check if some pics have not their corresponding metadatas and move them in another folder
- Also loop over Albums (instead of only "Photos from XXXX" folders)
- Try to get exported data from Google Takeout's API directly instead of downloading it manually
